# Self-Hosted Transactional Data Pipeline

This project implements a production-style data pipeline using:

- Python for ingestion and automation
- PostgreSQL for data storage and analytics
- Docker for containerized deployment
- Self-hosted infrastructure

The system simulates transactional data, processes it through ingestion and transformation layers, and validates pipeline health.
